Covey.Town Virtual Meeting Space 

I implemented a rock paper scissors game in Typescript with asynchronous communication.
I designed the frontend in React with leaderboard displaying top 10 players.


*SITE IS  CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE DUE TO NETLIFY SUBSCRIPTION*.
The game is available at https://fall-22-team-project-group-503.netlify.app/
